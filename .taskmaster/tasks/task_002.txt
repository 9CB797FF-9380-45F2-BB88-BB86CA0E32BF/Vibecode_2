# Task ID: 2
# Title: TensorFlow.js Integration & Object Detection Model Loading
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate TensorFlow.js into the project and load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., COCO-SSD) from TensorFlow Hub. Implement a mechanism to indicate model loading status.
# Details:
Add TensorFlow.js and a suitable object detection model (e.g., `@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd`) to `package.json`. Write JavaScript code to asynchronously load the model and display a 'Loading AI Model...' message until it's ready.

# Test Strategy:
Confirm TensorFlow.js is loaded without errors. Verify the model loads successfully and a 'Model Loaded' message appears in the console or UI.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add TensorFlow.js CDN to HTML [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add TensorFlow.js library via CDN to the HTML file
### Details:
Add TensorFlow.js script tag to index.html head section. Use the latest stable version from CDN. Also add TensorFlow.js model loading utilities.

## 2. Create ObjectDetectionModel class [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a JavaScript class to handle TensorFlow.js model loading and management
### Details:
Create ObjectDetectionModel class in main.js that handles loading COCO-SSD model from TensorFlow Hub, managing model state, and providing prediction methods. Include proper error handling for model loading failures.

## 3. Add model loading status UI [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add UI elements to show model loading progress and status
### Details:
Add loading indicator, progress bar, and status messages to show when TensorFlow.js model is being loaded. Update the status message area to display model loading progress and completion status.

## 4. Integrate model loading with camera controller [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the ObjectDetectionModel with CameraController to load model when camera starts
### Details:
Modify CameraController to initialize and load the ObjectDetectionModel when camera starts. Add proper error handling and status updates. Ensure model is loaded before enabling object detection features.
