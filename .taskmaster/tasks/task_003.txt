# Task ID: 3
# Title: Real-time Object Detection Pipeline Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Continuously capture frames from the live camera stream, feed them to the loaded TensorFlow.js model, and extract bounding boxes, class names, and confidence scores for detected objects.
# Details:
Create a loop that processes video frames. Use `model.detect(videoElement)` to perform inference. Log detected objects' details (class, score, bbox) to the console. Implement a basic visual overlay (e.g., red rectangles) for debugging bounding boxes.

# Test Strategy:
Point camera at various objects; verify bounding boxes appear and class names are logged correctly. Check for performance bottlenecks (frame rate).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create frame capture and processing loop [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a continuous loop that captures frames from the video stream and processes them for object detection
### Details:
Create a requestAnimationFrame loop that captures frames from the video element and processes them through the object detection model. Include frame rate limiting to maintain performance (target 10-15 FPS). Handle the async nature of object detection properly.

## 2. Implement object detection result processing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Process and filter object detection results from the AI model
### Details:
Create functions to process detection results, filter by confidence threshold, and extract relevant information (class names, bounding boxes, confidence scores). Implement result caching to avoid duplicate processing of similar frames.

## 3. Create bounding box visualization system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement visual overlay system to display detected objects with bounding boxes
### Details:
Create a system to draw bounding boxes and labels on detected objects. Use HTML5 Canvas overlay or CSS positioning to display rectangles around detected objects. Include object class names and confidence scores as labels.

## 4. Add detection controls and settings [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add UI controls for adjusting detection parameters and toggling detection on/off
### Details:
Create UI controls for confidence threshold, detection frequency, and enable/disable detection. Add a detection status indicator and performance metrics display. Allow users to customize detection settings in real-time.

## 5. Integrate detection pipeline with camera controller [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the detection pipeline with the camera controller and handle start/stop events
### Details:
Modify CameraController to start/stop the detection pipeline when camera starts/stops. Ensure proper cleanup of detection resources and handle edge cases like model not loaded or camera errors. Add detection status to the main status display.
